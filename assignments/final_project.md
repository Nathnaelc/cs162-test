# Final project:
## Description

The final project for CS162 will consist of groups of roughly 6 students 
implementing a project chosen from the suggestions given in assignment 1. 
There will be a matching process to ensure that most students will be working
on a project they are interested in.

Within the team, students are encouraged to specialize where appropriate. 
There are lots of options which may be appropriate to your particular project.
Lots of students tend to favor either frontend or backend programming, so
it might make sense to try and form subteams which focus on those aspects. 
If the database requires a lot of complex queries then consider assigning 
one person to focus entirely on writing those queries. Some students are 
great at design, and it is worthwhile giving total design freedom!

There will also need to be a single managerial position within each team.
The main responsibility of this position will be to attend an occasional 
meetings with the professor and to report or progress / roadblocks. The 
person chosen will usually be the same person who suggested the project,
but this is not a necessity. It is worth pointing out that the managerial
position is not a fulltime position, and coding is still expected, on top
of attending meetings.

The final project is introduced early in the course, and students are encouraged
to start working early as well. It is possible (and even encouraged) that you
try finish the project early in the semester and free up significant time for
other courses.

### Grading:
Everything will be managed from a github repo, and this will allow the tracking
of individual contributions to the project.
A significant portion of your grade (25% - 40%) will also depend on whether or
not there was successful collaboration within the project which led to a useful
product. So if there are issues that affect the whole project, but no-one wants 
to fix, then it is in the interests of the whole team to get the issue fixed!

It is possible for a student to specialize in something which does not produce
lots of code (for example design work). In this case, the student must track
their own progress, and be prepared to explain the work that they have done.

### Arbitration:
Group work can have many failure modes, and the probability of these failure
modes tends to increase with the size of the group. To this end, students are
encouraged to be proactive in ensuring that there is a harmonious and
collaborative working environment. This experience is meant to closely simulate
a professional working environment, so please remember to remain professional!

If a collaborative working environment is not possible, please approach your
instructor who shall have the final say on how to proceed. In extreme cases, the
instructor will be able to approve the transferral of work away from obstructive
students which will result in that student receiving a lower grade.

### Submission:
Please submit a pdf containing two sections:
1. Links to meaningful pull requests you have authored. Extensive 
documentation is also permissible as a gradable pull request.
2. Links to meaningful pull requests you have reviewed. A good review will contain
lots of constructive criticism, or feedback showing a deep understanding of the
pull request. Your comments must have been addressed by the author.

A PR is meaningful, if it:
 - implements any small part of the project
 - has a clear description of the feature (inside the pull request)
 - has docstrongs and/or tests (where applicable)
 - is self-contained (ie. it should be possible to completely understand the PR by reading only the PR)
 - has been reviewed and approved by a team member
 - has been successfully merged into the master branch

### FAQ:
1. *I specialized in a non-coding role, what do I submit?* 
In this case, please submit detailed information clearly highlighting the work 
you produced, and how it helped advance the project. Please note that it is 
still expected that you will review other students' pull requests.

2. *Help! No-one else on my team wants to work!* 
In this case, you are encouraged to let the professor know. The professor is 
likely to arrange a group check in during class, and interrogate all students 
on the progress made individually over the past two weeks. This is usually 
very helpful in terms of getting the project going. (This occurs several times 
naturally during the semester anyway.)

3. *Should I explain the pull requests in the pdf I submit?*
Please don't! A good pull request will have a sufficiently detailed explanation
that anyone should be able to read it and understand the feature being implemented
(or the bug being fixed)! Use the time you've saved to build a better website!

4. *How will specialized roles be graded?*
This is a great question! Most academic assignments require you to do everything
yourself, which guarantees some sort of consistency. In this case however there
are specialized roles, and sticking strictly to the grading rubric might give a student
scores in only a single LO. Instead the scores will be distributed across several of
the most relevant LOs, even if they do not strictly apply. This is the best way to
ensure consistency of the weight of the final project for all students. This is the
approach taken even for students in unspecialized roles who show a slight preference 
for a specific aspect of the project.

## Focused Outcomes Added

- **#algorithms**: Apply algorithmic thinking strategies to solve problems and 
effectively implement working code. (C) FA
- **#breakitdown**: Organize problems into tractable components and design 
solutions. (H) EA
- **#cs162-communication**: Ensure that all code, documentation and commit 
messages are clearly written with explanations where appropriate.
- **#cs162-abstraction**: Design interfaces (class interfaces, user interfaces, 
etc.) that are easy to use and hide much of the complexity needed for the 
implementation.
- **#cs162-separationofconcerns**: Design systems such that any task is handled by 
exactly one component and each component handles conceptually similar tasks.
- **#cs162-testing**: Write comprehensive and meaningful testing code for the system.
