# Final project

## Description

The final project for CS162 comprises groups of roughly 6 students
implementing a project chosen from the suggestions given in the first assignment.
There is a matching process to ensure that most students are working
on a project they are interested in.

Within the team, students are encouraged to specialize where appropriate.
There are lots of options that may be appropriate to your particular project.
Lots of students tend to favor either frontend or backend programming, so
it might make sense to try and form subteams that focus on those aspects.
If the database requires a lot of complex queries then consider assigning
one person to focus entirely on writing those queries. Some students are
great at design, and it is worthwhile giving them total design freedom!

There also needs to be a single managerial position within each team.
The main responsibility of this position is to attend occasional
meetings with the professor and to report on progress and roadblocks. The
person chosen will usually be the same person who suggested the project,
but this is not a requirement. It is worth pointing out that the managerial
position is not a full-time position, and coding is still expected, on top
of attending meetings.

The final project is introduced early in the course, and students are encouraged
to start working early as well. It is possible (and even encouraged) that you
try to finish the project before week 15 and free up time for other courses.

## Grading

The whole project is managed from a GitHub repo, and this allows the tracking
of individual contributions to the project.
A significant portion of your grade (25%–40%) depends on whether or
not there is successful collaboration within the project which leads to a useful
product. So if there are issues that affect the whole project, but no one wants
to fix them, it is in the interest of the whole team to get the issue fixed!

It is possible for a student to specialize in something which does not produce
lots of code (for example design work). In this case, the student must track
their own progress, and be prepared to demonstrate the work that they have done.
Instead of providing links to the code they wrote, such a student would provide
links to the mockups they made, for example.

### Group Demo

You have to produce a demonstration of how your app works.
This demonstration should take the form of a screen recording using
[Loom](https://loom.com/) or a similar tool.
The demonstration should have a video showing how to use the app and include
an audio recording where you explain what you are doing as you are doing it.
This is part of the group project so only make one recording for the group.
Work together to write a short script and produce the recording.
The demo video will typically be 10–15 minutes long, and will typically
highlights:

- creating an account
- logging in
- major features of the app
- logging out
- a high level overview of the tech stack
- how the app is deployed

### Individual Oral interviews

As part of the final project grading process, there will be short oral interviews.
These interviews will be scheduled during or shortly after the final week,
and will be conducted on Forum. Each group will be scheduled together. The
group interview will be an hour long, but you will only be required to
be present and talk for ±10 minutes.
The purpose of the interview is to ensure that
students have a good understanding of the code they wrote, and that they
understand the tech stack they used. The interview will be conducted in a
friendly manner, and will be a conversation rather than an interrogation.

Students should come to the interview prepared:

- to share their screen
- with all relevant PRs open in browser tabs
- with any other relevant work open in browser tabs
- to answer specific questions about the code they wrote. The questions will
  be about the code itself, and not about the project as a whole.

You can expect the professor to have watched the group demo, and browsed
your final project submission before the interview.

## Arbitration

Group work can have many failure modes, and the probability of these failure
modes tends to increase with the size of the group. To this end, students are
encouraged to be proactive in ensuring that there is a harmonious and
collaborative working environment. This experience is meant to closely simulate
a professional working environment, so please remember to remain professional!

If a collaborative working environment is not possible, please approach your
instructor who will have the final say on how to proceed. In extreme cases, the
instructor will be able to approve the transferral of work away from obstructive
students which will result in that student receiving a lower grade.

## Submission

Submit a PDF containing two sections:

1. Links to meaningful pull requests you created and for which you wrote the code.
   Extensive documentation is also permissible as a gradable pull request.
   Non-coding work (like design work) should also be linked.

2. Links to meaningful pull requests (or other work) you reviewed. A good review
   will contain lots of useful feedback, constructive criticism, and specific
   actions that can be taken to improve the code/work.
   Your comments must have been addressed by the author either by refuting them
   (and not making any changes) or incorporating the feedback into their work.

A PR is meaningful if it:

- implements a small component of the project
- has a clear description of the feature (inside the pull request)
- has docstrings and/or tests (where applicable)
- is self-contained (i.e., it should be possible to completely understand the PR by reading only the PR)
- has been reviewed and approved by a team member
- has been successfully merged into the master branch

## FAQ

1. _I specialized in a non-coding role, what do I submit?_
   In this case, please submit detailed information highlighting the work
   you produced, and how it helped advance the project. If you did design work,
   include links to the designs, and also include some example screenshots of the
   designs. (Add before/after screenshots if your design work was in reference to
   a particular issue. Please note that it is
   still expected that you will review other students' pull requests.

2. _Help! No one else on my team wants to work!_
   In this case, you are encouraged to let the professor know. The professor is
   likely to arrange a group check-in during class, and interrogate all students
   on the progress made individually over the past two weeks. This is usually
   very helpful in terms of getting the project going. (This occurs several times
   naturally during the semester anyway.)

3. _Should I explain the pull requests in the PDF I submit?_
   Please don't! All documentation and explanations _must_ be in the pull requests
   themselves! Anyone should be able to read it and understand the feature being implemented
   (or the bug being fixed)! Use the time you've saved to build a better website!

4. _How will specialized roles be graded?_
   This is a great question! Most academic assignments require you to do everything
   yourself, which guarantees consistency in the number and type of LOs graded.
   This course is testing assessment type grading, which allows transparency in
   your grade regardless of which LOs are graded. Expect ±25% of your
   final grade to come from this final project. If you are unsure of the assessment
   type grading, please ask your instructor for more details.
