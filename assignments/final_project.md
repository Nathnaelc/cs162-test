# Final project
## Description

The final project for CS162 comprises groups of roughly 6 students 
implementing a project chosen from the suggestions given in the first assignment. 
There is a matching process to ensure that most students are working
on a project they are interested in.

Within the team, students are encouraged to specialize where appropriate. 
There are lots of options that may be appropriate to your particular project.
Lots of students tend to favor either frontend or backend programming, so
it might make sense to try and form subteams that focus on those aspects. 
If the database requires a lot of complex queries then consider assigning 
one person to focus entirely on writing those queries. Some students are 
great at design, and it is worthwhile giving them total design freedom!

There also needs to be a single managerial position within each team.
The main responsibility of this position is to attend occasional 
meetings with the professor and to report on progress and roadblocks. The 
person chosen will usually be the same person who suggested the project,
but this is not a requirement. It is worth pointing out that the managerial
position is not a full-time position, and coding is still expected, on top
of attending meetings.

The final project is introduced early in the course, and students are encouraged
to start working early as well. It is possible (and even encouraged) that you
try to finish the project before week 15 and free up time for other courses.

## Demo

You have to produce a demonstration of how your app works.
This demonstration should take the form of a screen recording using [Loom](https://loom.com/) or a similar tool.
The demonstration should have a video showing how to use the app and include an audio recording where you explain what you are doing as you are doing it.
This is part of the group project so not everybody needs to make a separate recording!
Work together to write a short script and produce the recording.
If you worked on this part of the project, you should explain that in your submission (see the Submission section below) and provide links to any resources (like a script) that you produced.
The demo video will typically be 2–5 minutes long.

## Grading

The whole project is managed from a GitHub repo, and this allows the tracking
of individual contributions to the project.
A significant portion of your grade (25%–40%) depends on whether or
not there is successful collaboration within the project which leads to a useful
product. So if there are issues that affect the whole project, but no one wants 
to fix them, it is in the interest of the whole team to get the issue fixed!

It is possible for a student to specialize in something which does not produce
lots of code (for example design work). In this case, the student must track
their own progress, and be prepared to demonstrate the work that they have done.
Instead of providing links to the code they wrote, such a student would provide
links to the mockups they made, for example.

## Arbitration

Group work can have many failure modes, and the probability of these failure
modes tends to increase with the size of the group. To this end, students are
encouraged to be proactive in ensuring that there is a harmonious and
collaborative working environment. This experience is meant to closely simulate
a professional working environment, so please remember to remain professional!

If a collaborative working environment is not possible, please approach your
instructor who will have the final say on how to proceed. In extreme cases, the
instructor will be able to approve the transferral of work away from obstructive
students which will result in that student receiving a lower grade.

## Submission

Submit a PDF containing two sections:

1. Links to meaningful pull requests you created and for which you wrote the code. Extensive 
documentation is also permissible as a gradable pull request.
Non-coding work (like design work) should also be linked.

2. Links to meaningful pull requests (or other work) you reviewed. A good review will contain
lots of useful feedback, constructive criticism, and specific actions that can be taken to improve the code/work.
Your comments must have been addressed by the author either by refuting them (and not making any changes) or incorporating the feedback into their work.

A PR is meaningful if it:
 - implements a small component of the project
 - has a clear description of the feature (inside the pull request)
 - has docstrings and/or tests (where applicable)
 - is self-contained (i.e., it should be possible to completely understand the PR by reading only the PR)
 - has been reviewed and approved by a team member
 - has been successfully merged into the master branch

## FAQ

1. *I specialized in a non-coding role, what do I submit?* 
In this case, please submit detailed information highlighting the work 
you produced, and how it helped advance the project. Please note that it is 
still expected that you will review other students' pull requests.

2. *Help! No one else on my team wants to work!* 
In this case, you are encouraged to let the professor know. The professor is 
likely to arrange a group check-in during class, and interrogate all students 
on the progress made individually over the past two weeks. This is usually 
very helpful in terms of getting the project going. (This occurs several times 
naturally during the semester anyway.)

3. *Should I explain the pull requests in the PDF I submit?*
Please don't! A good pull request will have a sufficiently detailed explanation
that anyone should be able to read it and understand the feature being implemented
(or the bug being fixed)! Use the time you've saved to build a better website!

4. *How will specialized roles be graded?*
This is a great question! Most academic assignments require you to do everything
yourself, which guarantees some sort of consistency. In this case, however, there
are specialized roles, and sticking strictly to the grading rubric might give a student
scores in only a single LO. Instead, the scores will be distributed across several of
the most relevant LOs, even if they do not strictly apply. This is the best way to
ensure consistency of the weight of the final project for all students. This is the
approach taken even for students in unspecialized roles who show a slight preference 
for a specific aspect of the project.
