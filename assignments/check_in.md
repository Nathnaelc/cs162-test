# Final Project Check-in

## Description

We have virtual check-in “meetings” approximately every two weeks where you report your progress during the past two weeks.

## Submission

Submit a PDF with the following sections.

1. **What the team did.** Write a short (50–150 words) summary, preferably in bullet-point format, of what the team as a whole (not only you) worked on since the last check-in assignment.
2. **What you worked on.** Write a short (50–150 words) summary, preferably in bullet-point format, of the work you did since the last check-in assignment. Provide links to your work, for example, pull requests, mockups, documentation, a Kanban board, etc.
3. **What you reviewed.** An important part of team work is reviewing and giving _actionable_ feedback on each other's work, including code, documentation, and design work. Write a short (50–150 words) summary, preferably in bullet-point format, of the work you reviewed. Provide links to pull requests, a Kanban board, etc., where your reviews can be read.

## Notes

This can be a really short submission. The typical check-in will have about 200 words _in total_, 1 link in the _What you worked on_ section and 1 link in the _What you reviewed_ section. Sometimes, you will have done more work and therefore submit a slightly longer check-in assignment. Keep it simple.

## Grading

These check-in assignments are not graded. However, they do contribute to your #Communication grade on the Final Project assignment.
