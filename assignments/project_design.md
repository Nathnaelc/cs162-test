# Project Design

The first assignment focuses on finding suitable projects for you and your
fellow students to tackle. Eric Ries defines a startup as “a human institution
designed to deliver a new product or service under conditions of extreme
uncertainty”. This suggests that whenever we have an initial idea, we should
focus on reducing the uncertainty surrounding that idea. To that end, you must
propose and verify an idea without writing code. Your suggested project needs
to satisfy the following constraints:

- The project needs to be achievable: can 5–7 programmers working part-time
  build it in 15 weeks?
- The project needs to solve a concrete need, and this need has been validated
  through a short experiment that you carried out.
- The project must be solvable using code. Ideally, the code will be in Python
  and will take the form of a web service but those are not absolute requirements.

This assignment requires a clear description of:

- The problem that needs solving or a need that is unmet.
- Who will benefit from this project (the “user” or “customer”, though it need
  not be commercial).
- The short experiment that you have already carried out in order to validate
  that your proposed user/customer does in fact need this problem solved (no
  code needs to be written for this assignment).

Submit a short PDF report (aim for around 1200 words) in which you make a
strong case that your project is worthwhile for this class to pursue. As an
appendix, please explain how you have used any AI tools to assist you. Please
note that there is _no_ wrong way to use AI tools in this course. If you are
able to use AI to write the whole assignment (eg. it came up with the idea,
the experiment, and summarised the results of the experiment), then feel
free to do so!

Tag and explain your application of appropriate HCs. Since you are running
an experiment, this is a great opportunity to revisit and apply some of the
Empirical Analyses HCs.

## Grading guide:

This assignment will receive 2x scores of #designthinking:

### IDEA (1x #designthinking):

Have you clearly identified a need, and proposed a project which will meet
that need? Is the project feasible, and appropriately scoped? Are the idea
and project both clearly described?

### EXPERIMENT (1x #designthinking):

Will the experiment validate/invalidate the idea? (Note that it is not
necessary that the experiment proves the idea for a good grade, it is also
ok if it disproves the idea.) Are there any sources of bias in your
experiment (eg. asking your mom for validation)? Is there any creativity
in your experiment?

## FAQs:

**Surveys:**
Lots of students ask other Minerva students to fill out a survey, this will
typically be scored a 3 on experiment, provided the questions and responses
are clearly laid out as an appendix. Also, make sure to ask the right
questions; it's no good asking someone if they would prefer an app exists,
no-one will say no. Instead, ask if they would have used such an app in the
past year.

**Feasibility:**
It can be tricky to evaluate feasibility if you are not already experienced
with software development. If you are uncertain, stay after class and ask!

**Experiment:**
Sometimes it makes sense just to focus on proving that there is an unmet
need without focusing on how the product would meet the need. Sometimes it
makes sense to prove that the proposed product will meet the need, and assume
that the need exists. The best experiments do a bit of both! Discuss with your
professor if you're unsure of what's appropriate for your idea.
