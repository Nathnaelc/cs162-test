# LBA: Final project user interview
## Description

Now that your final project has been defined, you need to communicate
regularly with the potential users of your system to ensure that a useful
product is built. For this location-based assignment, you need to find a potential user of
your system in your city and conduct an in-depth interview with them.

If this
is happening early in the development cycle then the point of the interview
is to make sure that the system as currently designed will be useful to
them.

If your interview is happening later in the semester, you should have a simple demo and make sure
that the user understands the system and is able to use the available
functionality.

Observing and talking to your user is the best way of validating your design, and testing any
assumptions that you might have about your project. Be sure to prepare
beforehand with a few questions around

 - identifying when the user would use your system
 - the typical tasks that a user expects to be able to accomplish with your system
 - the user flows that a user expects for each task

It is in your best interest as a team to coordinate amongst yourselves and ensure that
these user interviews occur periodically throughout the semester to ensure that
there is regular and consistent feedback to guide the final project.

* Some team members should conduct user interviews before you start coding your product to validate your design ideas.
* Some team members should conduct user interviews once you have a simple MVP or even just detailed mockups of your MVP.
* Some team members should conduct user interviews later in the semester to get feedback on each iteration of your product as you complete each iteration.

Share the feedback from each interview with the whole team so you can improve your project together.

## Assignment submission

- Submit a PDF clearly detailing all the questions or instructions you provided to the user, all 
  the answers that the user gave, and highlight how talking to the user helped 
  improve the system, or where you were able to correct small miscommunications 
  from previous interviews.
- Clearly provide the details of where and when the user interview was conducted.
- Clearly explain your conclusions from the user interview. Are there any changes you would recommend making to the design based on the user feedback?
- Pay attention to the #organization of your report. Put the most important information (the context of the user interview and your conclusions) first and then provide the supporting information. If you have detailed records (like interview notes or transcripts), add those as appendices.
