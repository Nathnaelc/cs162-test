# Final project “stand-up meeting”

## Description

We have virtual standup meetings every other week where you report your progress during the past two weeks and describe what you want to work on during the next two weeks.

### Guidelines

* Be specific. For example, don't write “I worked on the database”; instead write “I created the database tables for storing nutritional information and implemented all the unit tests for the new tables.”

* If you added any code to your project repository, provide links to the pull requests. If you created any designs or collected data, provide links to where those items live — ideally everything would live in your project repo.

* Also provide links to the pull requests you reviewed.

* It is okay if you didn't work on any code during a particular 2-week cycle. Some people will write more code that others and that is expected.

### Submission

Submit a PDF with the following very short points.

1. What you did during the past 2 weeks.
2. What you will do during the next 2 weeks.
3. A list of pull requests or other links that you created.
4. A list of pull requests that you reviewed.
