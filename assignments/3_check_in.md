# Project Check-in

## Description
You are now halfway between the final project being announced, until 
the time it is due. This is a good time to check in and ensure that all 
team members are contributing to the final project.

### Submission:
You must submit a pdf containing links to at least one of each:
1. A meaningful PR which you have authored.
2. A meaningful PR which you have reviewed.

A PR is meaningful, if it:
 - implements any small part of the project
 - has a clear description of the feature
 - has been reviewed and approved by someone else
 - has been successfully merged into the master branch

Note that some roles can have minimal coding. This is ok, but you will still 
need to review PRs. You will also need to provide other forms 
of proof that you have been working on the project. Such proof may take many
forms, including: 
 - Simple wireframes for designers
 - Documentation of significant managerial direction
If you plan on submitting anything different then it is worthile checking 
with your professor if it is suitable.
