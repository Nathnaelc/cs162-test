# Project Check-in

## Description
You are now halfway between the final project being announced, until 
the time it is due. This is a good time to check in and ensure that all 
team members are contributing to the final project.

### Submission:
You must submit a pdf containing links to:
1. One meaningful Pull Request (PR) which you have authored.
1. One meaningful PR which you have reviewed.

A PR is meaningful, if it:
 - implements any small part of the project
 - has a clear description of the feature (inside the pull request)
 - has docstrings and/or tests (where applicable)
 - is self-contained (i.e. it should be possible to completely understand the PR by reading only the PR)
 - has been reviewed and approved by a team member
 - has been successfully merged into the main branch

### Notes:
1. The typical submission will literally be a nearly blank pdf, with your name, and 
    two links to pull requests. There is no need to do anything more in the submission.
    Instead focus on doing great work in the project itself!
1. Some roles can have minimal coding. This is ok, but you will still 
    need to review PRs. You will also need to provide other forms 
    of proof that you have been working on the project. Such proof may take many
    forms, including: 
    - Simple wireframes for designers
    - Documentation of significant managerial direction
    If you plan on submitting anything different then it is worthwhile checking 
    with your professor if it is suitable.
