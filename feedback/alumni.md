# Alumni feedback

Here is some feedback received over the years about the CS162 from students who have 
since gone on to do a related summer internship, or else they have found work as a software engineer:

## Using source control:
> Hey Prof, I just wanted to say thanks for all the material in CS162. I'm currently interning as a data scientist at a company and just because of CS162, I feel it is soooooooooo much easier to navigate repositories, use github, navigate dependency problems etc.

## UML:
> I know it is already August and CS162 finished over 3 months ago, but I would like to express some gratitude for all I learned during the semester. As the reflection exercise we did in the last class showed, there was a lot to take in, learn more about, and still many previously "unknown unknowns" that became known unknowns. Pardon the butchery of the original Rumsfeld quote. 
>  
> With particular joy, I'd like to thank the presence of UML diagrams in the curriculum, oddly enough. I must admit that I did not expect to use them any time soon by the time we learned about them. As it turns out, they have been incredibly useful to communicate important stuff between teams that otherwise would hardly be speaking the same language, for a pretty important project we are working on. I'm not working as an engineering intern, but the SWEs thought the diagram pretty good, while the non-engineers didn't know about them at all.
