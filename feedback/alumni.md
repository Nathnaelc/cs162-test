# Alumni feedback

Here is some feedback received over the years about the CS162 from students who have 
since gone on to do a related summer internship, or else they have found work as a software engineer:

## Using source control:
> Hey Prof, I just wanted to say thanks for all the material in CS162. I'm currently interning as a data scientist at a company and just because of CS162, I feel it is soooooooooo much easier to navigate repositories, use github, navigate dependency problems etc.

## UML:
> I know it is already August and CS162 finished over 3 months ago, but I would like to express some gratitude for all I learned during the semester. As the reflection exercise we did in the last class showed, there was a lot to take in, learn more about, and still many previously "unknown unknowns" that became known unknowns. Pardon the butchery of the original Rumsfeld quote. 
>  
> With particular joy, I'd like to thank the presence of UML diagrams in the curriculum, oddly enough. I must admit that I did not expect to use them any time soon by the time we learned about them. As it turns out, they have been incredibly useful to communicate important stuff between teams that otherwise would hardly be speaking the same language, for a pretty important project we are working on. I'm not working as an engineering intern, but the SWEs thought the diagram pretty good, while the non-engineers didn't know about them at all. 

## Foundational principles:
> I hope this email finds you well. I just wanted to drop you a quick note to give you an update on my life since graduation.

> I wanted to thank you again for the amazing education I received in your CS classes at Minerva. I'm now working as a Data Scientist at XXXXXXXXX and I'm so glad to say that I'm using a lot of what I learned in your classes on a daily basis. It’s a small startup so I get to wear a lot of hats so both CS162 and the Deep Learning tutorial come in handy. I’m doing a lot of OOP for an agent based model..., I’m developing and maintaining our data stack, and more recently I got to do some Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

> It's so cool to see how the concepts from the classroom come together in the real world. Your classes gave me a good understanding of the foundational principles but were also very hands-on, which now allows me to apply them out in the wild. I'm grateful for your guidance and support throughout my time at Minerva, and I wouldn't be where I am today without you.
