ðŸ’¡ **TL;DR:**
1. Divide work clearly.
2. Start coding early.
3. Keep each other accountable. 
4. Help each other out.


## Overview

CS162 Final Project is hard, whether you are good at coding or not. This is because you are working in a team which require more coordination and dependencies, and regardless of how much you know, with software engineering there is always more you donâ€™t know. So treat this as a learning opportunity If you put in efforts, you will learn a lot. 

Here are a few things that will help you along the way. 

## Team organization

1. Have a meeting early on to talk about logistic. Things to consider:
    - What is everyoneâ€™s workload and degree of commitment to the project?
        - Minerva is tough and you are in it together. Knowing peopleâ€™s degree of commitment will help delegate tasks easily later on.
    - What is the MVP?
        - Donâ€™t be too ambitious - scope it as minimally as you can. You can always add things later.
        - Try to make it into a list of requirements that you can check-off.
        - Have a rough drawing as well so everyone can imagine what it is. Hereâ€™s what I did for my project:
            
            ![MVP Wireframe Mock-up Example](MVP.png)            
    - What is everyone interested in working on?
        - Think of the skills you want to learn this semester.
    - What is everyone experienced in?
        - This is so you can help each otherâ€™s out. E.g. I wanted to learn back-end but have experience with front-end, so was helping front-end team a lot.
        - Itâ€™s also good to have a resource section to help people learn!
    - How often do we want to schedule check-ins?
        - Be realistic. We used to schedule weekly check-ins but most people would not be doing work and so the momentum died off early on. Bi-weekly, or even monthly check-ins might be better.
        - Staying 30 minutes after class or 30 minutes before class is often a good time for everyone to meet.
        - Send Calendar invites!
    - How can we keep each other accountable?
        - Deadlines is one thing, but also be creative! Can you schedule co-working session? Can you have team dinner where if someone doesnâ€™t work, they pay for the dinner?
2. Set up a Notion page or another project management tool for task tracking, etc. + communication tool (Telegram).
3. Try to divide the work as clearly as possible. This typically means 2 people front-end, 2-3 people back-end + database, 1 person design/ business/ devops. Afterwards, divide the work by features/ requirements.
4. Have 1 person as point-of-contact i.e. doing project management. 

## Working on project

1. **Start early!!** You can start coding once you scoped out the MVP. If you are trying to learn something new, see point 2.
    - For front-end, even if you donâ€™t have a design yet, you can start building components and add CSS later.
    - For back-end, you can start thinking about database schema and create PostgreSQL database and API endpoints.
    - For dev-ops, start writing CI/CD pipelines, integration tests, Docker containers, etc.
    - For design, have a rough Figma sketch and iterate as you go through the semester.
2. If you are learning a new technology:
    - Think of the task you want to do, learn just enough to start working on it, then learn more as you figure things out along the way.
    - If it helps, have a deadline on what you are learning and stick to it e.g. I will learn the basics of React for 1 week, and then start working on this feature.
    - Google and StackOverFlow is your friend. But also, ask your teammates/ prof/ TA for help.
    - If the entire team is new, choose a really simple technology stack (pure Flask with HTML template in Jinja is better than Flask + React).
3. If you already have experience:
    - Help others in your team. Offer co-working/ pair programming/ etc. Share resources with others on how you learn technology.
    - Help set expectations for newer people e.g. learning HTML/ CSS + a little React is maybe realistic, HTML/ CSS + React + PostgreSQL is probably not.
    - Be ready to take more ownership than you originally sign up for.
4. Align your work with assignments. Thereâ€™s 1 for front-end pretty early on and 1 for database later that you can swap for working on final project. Use those opportunities so you can both work on final project + skip an assignment!
5. In case it wasnâ€™t emphasized, **start early!!!!!**

## Technical details

1. Tech stack: Flask is the easiest because you will also be learning it in class, but for industry standards, Flask (backend) + React (frontend) might be a better choice. A full Javascript stack (React + Express/ NextJS) might also be good. 
    - Good resources for front-end
        
        Choose 1 of 2:
        
        - FreeCodeCamp (Do HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React sections. The 300 hours is an estimated, it actually is a lot faster.)
        - The Odin Project
    - Good resources for Flask
        
        Do these 2 tutorials. It might be repetitive but it will help your understanding. For Miguel blog, he also has one that connects to React (separate from this) that you might want to try **IF you already know React** (otherwise it will be too much).

2. Database: PostgreSQL/ SQLite as a database is pretty standard. MongoDB might work, but classes (& most applications in the real world) focus on SQL databases more.
3. Deployment: We usually use Heroku for deployment but now that itâ€™s not free, check out **Vercel/ Netlify** for front-end and **Railway** for back-end + database deployment. 
4. Working in Git:
    - Always create a new branch and create a pull request to not introduce breaking changes
    - Have clear commit messages
    - Have clear README to help prof and TA understand whatâ€™s going on.
    
    (Basically everything you learnt in Session 3).
    
5. Google and Stackoverflow are your best friends. Also look at other peopleâ€™s Github projects to see how they build something similar to yours.
