## AI Statment:
I used ChatGPT for data generation, content suggestions, and automation. After receiving AI-generated work, I conducted quality assurance and resolved AI-induced bugs. For example, the last query wasn't producing the expected results by excluding the sold listings so I added another filtration to exclude the sold properties.
