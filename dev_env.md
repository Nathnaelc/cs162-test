# The CS162 Development Environemnt
To simplify collaboration, and ensure that students have an efficient development environment, part of the preclass work in the 
first few classes is to install tools and configure them appropriately.

This course encourages you to use the [VS Code editor](https://code.visualstudio.com/), but will not require it. However, you will be required to use an
editor which does allow autoformatting, linting, and [copilot integration]([https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/getting-started-with-github-copilot]. 


## Class 1:

Required:
- Sign up for a [GitHub account](https://github.com/)
- Sign up for the [GitHub student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack)
- Sign up for a [ChatGPT account](https://chat.openai.com/)
- Register your github account for this course using the this [form](https://forms.gle/bycmVGgUmMDotEvZA)
  
Optional, but strongly encouraged:
- Install [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) (if you don't use VS code, make sure to use an IDE with all the features required for this course: autoformatting, linting, and copilot integration).
- Reinstall [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to version 3.11.x

## Class 2:
Required:
- Sign up for free use of GitHub Copilot
- Install [Python Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) in your text editor, and ensure that it autoformats whenever you save a python file. [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.black-formatter)
- Install [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) in your text editor, and ensure that it highlights any code which is not flake8 compliant. [VSCode installation](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse160/20au/computing/setup.html#setup-linter-flake8)

Optional:
- Using a chatbot or search, find out about the differences between autoformatting code, and linting code. 

## Class 3:
Required:
- [Install Git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git).
- [Create ssh keys, and  add them to your github account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh).
- Clone the [cs162](https://github.com/minerva-university/cs162) repository, and open it in your editor. If this is not visible, ensure that you have filled out the registration form from the first class.
- Create a [virtual environment](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/), activate it, and install a python package (eg. `pip install flask`)
