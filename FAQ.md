#### Setting up Python 3

Q: How do I know if my computer has already had Python 3 or not?

A: Open up Terminal (on Mac) or CMD (on Windows) and type python3 into the window. If your computer does not have Python 3, it should appear like this:

![Python 3 not installed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25260669/35329658-b020c404-0126-11e8-9f87-cd37f537c65c.png)

If Python 3 has already been installed, a version number will be displayed:

![Python 3 installed](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/25260669/35329803-28b01ef6-0127-11e8-992d-7f5481cec3ee.png)

Finally, type exit() to get out from the Python shell.

Q: How do I set up Python 3?

A: You can go [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to download the latest version and install the package.

Q: How do I install a Python editor?
