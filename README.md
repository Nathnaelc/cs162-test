# CS162 - Software Engineering

Students are free to suggest modifications to this code by cloning, modifying and submitting a pull request.  It is suggested that students initially sketch out the modification and confirm with the course instructor that it is a suitable modification.  Open an issue, as part of the suggestion.  If the course instructor agrees then go ahead and create the entire modification (as a pull request). Once merged, then the student will be eligible for a 4 on the most relevant LO for the next assignment.  If 3 such modifications are accepted then the scores may be combined into a single 5 (at the student's discretion).  Modifications must be either substantive explanations, or else significant reworking/creation of class exercises.

Some of these directories will not align with the most recent version of the syllabus.  In all such cases the syllabus should be viewed as the authoritative source of information and you are encouraged to inform your instructor of the discrepancy.

## How to submit your pre-class work
1. [Accept this assignment in GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/a/4K6vDarz)
2. You will get a private repository in which you can complete and submit your pre-class work for every class starting from Session 4.
3. Follow the instructions in the pre-class work assignment README.

Remember that you are encouraged to help each other as well! 

The line between collaboration and plagiarism can be blurry sometimes. Here is a rough guide to help.

* If you copy-pasted something from the Internet, eg stackoverflow, provide the URL in a code comment or in the text of your report.
* If you are using a line of code that you got from someone else and you don't know how it works, it's probably cheating.
* If you're pasting more than 10 lines of code from another student, it's cheating regardless of how well you understand the code — and even if you change the variable names, comments, or other non-functional parts of the code.
* **When in doubt list all your collaborators and sources!** Then it's not cheating. You might get a lower grade if it seems that you don't understand the code you copied but you won't get sent to the ASC. Surprisingly many students don't heed this advice — and get sent to the ASC.

## Editors
It is strongly recommended that you use one of the following editors:
 - [Atom](https://atom.io/)
 - [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/)
 - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (not Visual Studio itself!)
 - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)

This list is not exhaustive, and there are a lot of good editors out there (see also Emacs and Vim if you want to be old school).
However it is essential that your code editor is powerful. It should be possible to install plugins which perform particular functionality (eg. make git easier to use, autoformat your code on save, have multiple cursors simultaneously).

The [FAQ](FAQ.md) provides links to short guides on how to install some of the editors and configure them as proper python development environments.

### Autoformatting
Please use [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/) to automatically format your code. If everyone uses automatic code formatting then it will save everyone a lot of time when working together. It's the worst when you pull someone else's code, change a single line, hit save, and hundreds of lines of changes occur.

If you don't like how black has formatted the code, then you can take a deep breath
and think about how standardization is important, and how it helps to avoid
endless debates about how to best layout code. Then you can move on to writing other
code with the time that you have saved avoiding those debates.
