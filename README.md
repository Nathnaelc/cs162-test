# CS162 - Software Engineering

Students are free to suggest modifications to this code by cloning, modifying and submitting a pull request.  It is suggested that students initially sketch out the modification and confirm with the course instructor that it is a suitable modification.  Open an issue, as part of the suggestion.  If the course instructor agrees then go ahead and create the entire modification (as a pull request). Once merged, then the student will be eligible for a 4 on the most relevant LO for the next assignment.  If many such modifications are accepted then the scores may be combined into a single 5 (at the prof's discretion).  Modifications must be either substantive explanations, or else significant reworking/creation of class exercises.
