# CS162 - Software Engineering

Students are free to suggest modifications to this code by cloning, modifying and submitting a pull request.  It is suggested that students initially sketch out the modification and confirm with the course instructor that it is a suitable modification.  Open an issue, as part of the suggestion.  If the course instructor agrees then go ahead and create the entire modification (as a pull request). Once merged, then the student will be eligible for a 4 on the most relevant LO for the next assignment.  If 3 such modifications are accepted then the scores may be combined into a single 5 (at the students discretion).  Modifications must be either substantive explanations, or else significant reworking/creation of class exercises.

Currently, the topic that needs documentation the most is for the initial setup.  Hint hint!  This would entail: a nice description of how to get a github account, how to install the latest version of python 3, how to pull this repo, and how to suggest changes to the repo.

Some of these directories will not align with the most recent version of the syllabus.  In all such cases the syllabus should be viewed as the authoritative source of information and you are encouraged to inform your instructor of the discrepancy.

This is a great package because it standardizes how all your python code should be.
If you don't like how yapf has formatted the code, then you can take a deep breath
and think about how standardization is important, and how it helps to avoid
endless debates about how to best layout code. Then you can move on to writing other
code with the time that you have saved.

Protip: Most code editors will have a yapf plugin which will automatically reformat the
code every time you save the file! Try to make sure everyone on your team does this!
